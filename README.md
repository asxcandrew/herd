# HERD - Federated publishing platform

> Federated publishing platform based on ActivityPub connected to the world of free social networking

Demo instance [herd.anonbecon.com](http://herd.anonbecon.com/)

It's not ready for production yet, check for updates our mastodon account [`@herd@mastodon.technology`](https://mastodon.technology/@herd) or matrix room: [`#herd:matrix.org`](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#herd:matrix.org/)

## Tech stack

This project combines several modern technologies that I like:

- vue.js on frontend
- Golang (go-gin) for backend
- Protocol Buffers and gRPC
- Docker

> Anyone who's slightly familiar or want to try one of this technologies is welcomed to join.

## Development
With [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed, run

```
$ make setup-dev
```

You can now execute the `make run-dev` command to start up the development.
Project server will be running at *http://localhost:90*

## Deployment

You need to create running postgres with created database before deploy.

```
> psql -c "CREATE DATABASE herd_production_db"
CREATE DATABASE
```

## What's next

Checklist to gauge how Herd`s development is going:

- [x] Setup application with development environment
- [ ] Full-featured text editor on client (in progress)
- [ ] Integrate basic ActivityPub features
- [ ] Use external service for image processing
- [ ] HTTPS by default
- [ ] IPFS for pictures storage as option
- [ ] Integration, unit testing

## Why?

It’s any piece of software that implements ActivityPub. That software can be wildly different in how it looks and what it does! But the social graph–what we call the people and their connections–is the same.

- Mastodon is the software built around 500-character text posts.
- You want a video platform? That’s PeerTube.
- You want something centered on photos and pictures? PixelFed is here.
- You want to write long, rich blog posts? Plume is in development.
